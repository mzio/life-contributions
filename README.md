# Life Contributions 

Inspired by the code-counting contributions graph on Github, but better / worse because it deals with life contributions.  
- Yes this also adds a commit to your GitHub contribution graph everytime you commit + contribute.   


### Edit 12/29/20
Just realized that `commits` has actual notes for when I experimented with this... I guess they are good examples for real-world usability?
