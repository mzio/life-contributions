# Things to do (Week of 7/1/19)

## 7/1


## 7/2

### Action Discovery
- Setup working moving MNIST data download [done] [categories: research, work, build]
- Setup moving MNIST data handler [done] [categories: research, work, build]

## 7/3

### Action Discovery
Get better understanding of how to do video processing / understanding of videos using Moving MNIST dataset

First try will be with doing unsupervised learning of activities
* To do so, need to have idea of encoder-decoder architecture and what to train against
* For pre-processing, given object and bounding box, predict the bounding box in the next frame?
  * Ideally would be able to generate entire frame, but this seems hard / not the purpose
  * There would be edge cases of new objects entering
  * But ideally the pre-processing feature extractor can also be applied to this, i.e. use this as a teacher-forcing model?

- Using PyTorch pretrained object detection model, output bounding boxes for objects [] [categories: research, work, build]
- Visualize these results in a notebook [] [categories: research, work, build]
- Construct a time-series model based on LSTMs? []
- Read about how sequence-based embeddings work

Decided that there wasn't enough support immediately, so going to try to do image reconstruction / frame prediction outright.
* Maybe actual reconstruction isn't necessary even, just trying to


### Logistics
- Add internal documents to lab repository [done] [categories: logistics, work]
- Add job tracking script to lab repository [done] [categories: logistics, work]

- Add pictures to github projects [done] [categories: personal, cs] 

## 7/4  

### Life Contributions  
- Figure out project structure and how it interfaces with github  
- Write processing scripts from markdown to csv    

### Yeung Lab  
- Update repos to track different remote branches for multiple versioning between Yeung Lab and personal repos  


## 7/5  

### Yeung Lab  
- Recreate the yeung-lab/moving-mnist repository, but setup so that we can push remotely to a different repository.  
- Update setup docs to include having remote github stuff

### Research  
- Confirm good first experiment to run re: moving-MNIST LSTM encoder
