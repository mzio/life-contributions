# Weekly Commits for 09/16/19

### Research  
- See what happens if we train the model with lr 1e-4 but with more epochs (200?) [done] [categories: research, UAD]  
  * It still doesn't lead to circular embeddings  
- Try to think of an embedding scheme that factors in co-occurence? [] [categories: research, code, UAD]  
  * This might lead to more smaller ones in the middle because they occur more frequently with more other segments.
- Implement riemannian gradient descent methods with geoopt [done] [categories: research, code, UAD]  
  * Mainly trying to solve why current setup doesn't work with pytorch  
    * Needed to change `solve` to `gesv` because still using PyTorch 1.1.0 (I think)
